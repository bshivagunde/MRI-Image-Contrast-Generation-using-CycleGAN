# MRI-Image-Contrast-Generation-using-CycleGAN
This project leverages a CycleGAN model with a modified U-Net architecture to generate artificial MRI images with varying contrast levels (e.g., T1 to T2) from existing MRI scans. The goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging by providing radiologists with additional, cost-effective image variations.
